<!-- What's the Difference between adding the script attribute in head section and in body section -->
<!-- The difference is that when the script is added in the head section, the script is executed before the body is loaded. -->
<!-- When the script is added in the body section, the script is executed after the body is loaded. -->
<!-- So in somecases we can't executed the docutment object before loading the body incase of putting the script in the head. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- <script>
        window.alert('Hello World');    
    </script> -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- <h1 id="demo"></h1> -->
    <button onclick="changeContent()">
        <div id="demo"> Click me</div>
    </button>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
