<!-- What's the Difference between adding the script attribute in head section and in body section -->
<!-- The difference is that when the script is added in the head section, the script is executed before the body is loaded. -->
<!-- When the script is added in the body section, the script is executed after the body is loaded. -->
<!-- So in somecases we can't executed the docutment object before loading the body incase of putting the script in the head. -->
